📚 Library Management System (LMS)
This is a full-stack Library Management System designed for managing books, memberships, and transactions in a library setup. It supports two user roles—Admin and User, each with specific permissions. The system is developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).
